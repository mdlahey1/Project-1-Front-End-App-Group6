# FilmDex

###  - Group 6 Project 1 Web Application -

## Description

- Web Application that utilizes multiple third party API's to provide Movie & TV Show information about reviews and streaming access from over 150+ services.

- With this project we wanted to build an application that brings together the tedious process of looking for your next Movie/TV Show all into one simple user experience. Instead of searching for reviews & then streaming avalibilty & then recomendations, we wanted to make this process quick and easy with our application The "FilmDex".

## The Future of FilmDex

- Future development would be to add more resoucres to movie cards as well as adding interactibility with movie recomendation cards so that users can continue searching through the recomended tab until they find a movie they are interested in. 

- Another future development would be to add another API resource that gets and displays data on access to cinema availability for searched movies.
